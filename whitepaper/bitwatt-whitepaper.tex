\section {Motivation}

Inefficiencies in the Australian retail power market mean residential solar energy producers are getting 6cents per kiloWatt hour for their output, which is immediately sold back to retail consumers for around 24cents per kiloWatt hour.

If we can increase the price paid for sustainably produced energy, we can increase the incentive to produce sustainable energy and grow the green economy.
